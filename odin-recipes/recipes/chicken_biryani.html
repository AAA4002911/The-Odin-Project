        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq and
            as
            far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls home has resulted in a wide variety of
            preparations and ingredients; however, it is typically prepared by layering seasoned chicken with rice and
            aromatics and steaming them together.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint,
                cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and
                toss together making sure the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to
                marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions
                until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set
                aside.</li>
            <li>While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until
                the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>To par-boil the rice, add the water, salt, cardamom, cumin and bay leaf to a pot and bring to a boil.
                Add the rice and boil for 7 minutes. Drain the rice, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
            <li>In the pot you caramelized the onions in, add the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down. Fry until
                golden brown on one side (about 5 minutes). Flip the chicken over and fry the other side until golden
                brown. Transfer the chicken back to the bowl you marinated it in.</li>
            <li>To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice
                mixture to the bottom of the pot you browned the chicken in.</li>
            <li>Top the rice with the chicken in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Top the chicken with an even layer of caramelized onions.</li>
            <li>Finish putting together the Biryani by adding the rest of the rice in an even layer. Add 1 cup of
                reserved liquid from boiling the rice. Cover the pot with a lid and put the pot on the stove over medium
                heat and set the timer for 20 minutes. When you can see steam escaping from under the lid, turn down the
                heat to low and continue cooking until the timer goes off and then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Without opening the lid, set the timer for another 10 minutes to steam the biryani.</li>
            <li>Mix the Chicken Biryani together and then transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and
                serve.</li>
