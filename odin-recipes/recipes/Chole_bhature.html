        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chole bhature is a food dish popular in the Northern areas of the Indian subcontinent. It is a combination of
            chana masala (spicy white chickpeas) and bhatura/puri, a deep-fried bread made from maida. Although it is
            known as a typical Punjabi dish, it is originally a culinary dish of Delhi and Uttar Pardesh.
            Chole bhature is often eaten as a breakfast dish, sometimes accompanied with lassi. It can also be street
            food or a complete meal and may be accompanied with onions, pickled carrots, green chutney or achaar.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the bhatura dough:</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Place all the ingredients except the water in a food processor, bowl of a stand mixer, or, if
                    kneading by hand, in a large bowl. Drizzle in the water and knead until you have an elastic but firm
                    dough. Place in an airtight container and set it aside while you make the chana masala.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Make the chana masala:</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the whole spices -- the bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon and cloves.
                    Finally add the cumin and stir to mix. When the cumin sizzles, add the onions with some salt and
                    cook until the onions turn golden-brown. </li>
                <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and saute for a minute. </li>
                <li> Add the cayenne and turmeric, saute for another minute, then add the diced tomatoes. Mix well and
                    let the tomatoes cook, stirring them frequently, until they are completely broken down and very
                    pulpy.</li>
                <li>
                    Add the chickpeas along with 2 cups of water and stir well. Add the chana masala spice mix. and stir
                    it in.</li>
                <li>
                    Bring to a boil, turn heat to low, cover and simmer about 15-20 minutes so all the flavors merge.
                    You can use a potato masher to mash some of the chickpeas and thicken the sauce. If the chana masala
                    looks too dry, add more water.</li>
                <li>
                    Squeeze in the lemon juice and garnish with coriander leaves, if using.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Make the bhatura:</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat oil for frying in a pan large enough to hold the bhatura. Divide the dough into 12 pieces and
                    roll each into a ball. Roll out into a circle about six to eight inches in diameter. Make sure you
                    roll the dough evenly, without any spots that are too thick or too thin. </li>
                <li>
                    When the oil is hot, about 360 degrees, place a bhatura into the pan, taking care not to splash the
                    oil on yourself. Use a spatula to press the bhatura down as it puffs up -- this will ensure it cooks
                    evenly and puffs into a ball.</li>
                <li>
                    Remove the bhatura to a colander lined with paper towels. Serve hot with the chana masala.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
